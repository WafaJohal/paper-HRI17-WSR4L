\begin{abstract}
An increasing amount of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) research is focused on the 
development of social robot tutors. While robots have been popular as a tool for 
STEM teaching, the use of robots as tutors is novel. The field of HRI has 
started to report on how to make effective robot tutors. However, many 
challenges remain. For instance, what interaction strategies aid learning, and 
which hamper learning? How can we deal with the current technical limitations of 
robots? Answering these and other questions requires a multidisciplinary effort, 
including contributions from pedagogy, developmental psychology, (computational) 
linguistics, artificial intelligence and HRI, among others. This abstract 
provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art in robot tutors and 
describes the aims of the Robots for Learning (R4L) workshop in bringing 
together a multidisciplinary audience for furthering the development of 
market-ready educational robots.

\section{Introduction}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% 1 paragraph high-level overview
%TODO refs throughout this par
An increasing amount of HRI research is focused on the development of social 
robots acting as tutors. While robots have been popular as a focus for STEM 
teaching (see Lego Mindstorms or Thymio \cite{riedo2012two}), the use of robots 
as tutors is novel. The field of HRI has started reporting on how to make 
effective robot tutors and how to measure their efficacy 
\cite{kennedy2016social,tanaka2015pepper}. Social robot tutors \comments{the jump to social robotics is a bit fast, we should include any robots using for educational purposes that aimto increase social interaction either between the robot and the user or among users} have the 
potential to enhance learning via kinesthetic interaction \cite{lemaignan2016}, can improve 
the learner's self-esteem \cite{}, and can provide empathic feedback 
\cite{castellano2013towards}. Finally, robots have been shown to engage the 
learner, to motivate her in the learning task or to enhance collaboration in a 
group \cite{}. However, many challenges remain and this workshop aims to bring 
together a multidisciplinary group of researchers to discuss these challenges 
and share expertise.

% 1 paragraph talk about previous version of workshop (what was done there, and what this will add)
The second iteration of this workshop builds on the previous version hosted at 
the IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication 
(RO-MAN), 2016. The previous workshop utilised keynote speakers, participant 
speakers, and small group discussions to raise issues and challenges facing the 
community researching robots for use in delivering educational content. The 
second version of this workshop seeks to engage with more researchers in the 
field, and draw a more multidisciplinary audience to further the development of 
market-ready educational robots.

\section{Background}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

% overview state-of-the-art for robots for learning (maybe also clarify what is meant by the term)

Mubin \cite{mubin2013review} distinguish three roles for robots in education:
\textbf{tutors} - providing help to students, \textbf{peers} - stimulating learning and \textbf{tools} - physically enhancing a concept to learn.

At first, in the 70's qnd 80's robots tented to be introduce in schools as a tool for teachers to teach about robotics or other STEM sciences. 
However, this specificity of usage of robots penalized their adoption in educational contexts \cite. 
Nowadays, with robots being cheaper and more easily deployable, application in education and deployment in schools become accessible to other types of learning.  


The current state of the art presents robots used in various learning scenarios related to non-programming curricula. 
Often involving social robots these scenario usually investigate the social aspect of the robot-learner relationship: empathy \cite{}, immediacy, spatial arrangement\cite{}, \dots

limits of the soa:
- Design of this experiment often without involving educational specialist or practitioners. 
- long term use of robots
- many works have been done in CSCL to introduce technologies (computers, tablets and other hci device ias tools) need to llok at how and why
- proving the impact of learning with a robot, is it only motivational?

% close by highlighting some challenges (which we can talk about addressing in outline...)
%However, many questions still remain. For instance, what interaction strategies aid learning, and which hamper learning? How can we deal with the current technical limitations of robots? How should effective lessons be developed and implemented on a robot? Answering these and other questions requires a multidisciplinary effort, including contributions from pedagogy, developmental psychology, (computational) linguistics, artificial intelligence and HRI, among others.

\section{Outline of the Workshop}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% who is the workshop intended for?
The aim of this workshop is to engage scholars who wish to gain expertise in 
education and in robotics. Participants will benefit from hearing from the 
forefront of field and from discussions on how to move from fundamental research 
towards the development of market-ready educational robots.

% how will the aims be achieved on the day?
The workshop aims will be achieved through

\begin{abstract}
 While robots have been popular as a tool for 
STEM teaching, the use of robots in other learning scenarios is novel. 
The field of HRI has 
started to report on how to make effective robots usable in educational contexts. However, many 
challenges remain. For instance, which interaction strategies aid learning, and 
which hamper learning? How can we deal with the current technical limitations of 
robots? Answering these and other questions requires a multidisciplinary effort, 
including contributions from pedagogy, developmental psychology, (computational) 
linguistics, artificial intelligence and HRI, among others. This abstract 
provides a brief overview of the current state-of-the-art in social robots designed for learning and 
describes the aims of the Robots for Learning (R4L) workshop in bringing 
together a multidisciplinary audience for furthering the development of 
market-ready educational robots.

\section{Introduction \& Background}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% 1 paragraph high-level overview
An increasing amount of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) research is focused on the development of applications of service robots in everyday life. 
In education, while robots have been popular as a focus for STEM 
teaching (cf. Lego Mindstorms or Thymio \cite{riedo2012two}), the use of robots in other learning scenarios is novel. 

Mubin et al. \cite{mubin2013review} distinguish three roles for robots in education:
1) \textbf{tutors} - providing help to students, 2) \textbf{peers} - stimulating learning, and 3) \textbf{tools} - physically enhancing a concept to learn.
In the 1970's and 80's robots tended to be introduced in schools as a tool for teachers to teach robotics or other STEM subjects. 
However, this specificity of robot usage penalized their adoption in educational contexts \cite{gander2013informatics}.
Nowadays, with robots being cheaper and more easily deployable, application in education becomes possible for other types of learning.

%\section{Background}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

% overview state-of-the-art for robots for learning (maybe also clarify what is meant by the term)




%The current state of the art presents robots used in various learning scenarios related to non-programming curricula. 
%Often involving social robots, these scenario usually investigate the social aspect of the robot-learner relationship (i.e. empathy \cite{castellano2013towards,leite2014empathic} or immediacy \cite{kennedy2016social})
%While certain research focus in one-to-one setup exploiting social and task adaptive systems to individuals, others aim to provide a tool for the therapist or educators in  their teaching practice. 

The field of HRI has started reporting on how to make 
effective robots and how to measure their efficacy 
\cite{kennedy2016social,tanaka2015pepper}. Robots have the 
potential to enhance learning via kinesthetic interaction, can improve 
the learner's self-esteem, and can provide empathic feedback 
\cite{castellano2013towards,lemaignan2016,tanaka2012children}. Finally, robots have been shown to engage the 
learner, to motivate her in the learning task or to stimulate collaboration in a 
group \cite{park2013providing}. However, many challenges remain and this workshop aims to bring 
together a multidisciplinary group of researchers to discuss these challenges 
and share expertise. Such challenges and questions that are yet to be comprehensively addressed by the research community include: the effective involvement of education practitioners in the design of activities, the outcome of long-term learning with robots, appropriate educational strategies for use in HRI, and the influence of HRI on affective aspects of learning, such as motivation and self-efficacy.

%Among challenges that need to be faced by the research community, we can mention: how to involve of practitioners in the design of educational activities? What is the effect of long-term training with robots? What interactions have an impact on learning? What educational strategies can be used in HRI? How does HRI have an impact on learners' motivation and self-efficacy?

The second iteration of this workshop builds on the previous version hosted at 
the IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication 
(RO-MAN), 2016. The previous workshop utilised keynote speakers, participant 
speakers, and small group discussions to raise issues and challenges facing the 
community researching robots for use in delivering educational content. The 
second version of this workshop seeks to engage with more researchers in the 
field, and draw a more multidisciplinary audience to further the development of 
market-ready educational robots.

% close by highlighting some challenges (which we can talk about addressing in outline...)
%However, many questions still remain. For instance, what interaction strategies aid learning, and which hamper learning? How can we deal with the current technical limitations of robots? How should effective lessons be developed and implemented on a robot? Answering these and other questions requires a multidisciplinary effort, including contributions from pedagogy, developmental psychology, (computational) linguistics, artificial intelligence and HRI, among others.

\section{Outline of the Workshop}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% who is the workshop intended for?
The aim of this workshop is to engage scholars who wish to gain expertise in 
education and in robotics. Participants will benefit from hearing from the 
forefront of field and from discussions on how to move from fundamental research 
towards the development of market-ready educational robots.

% how will the aims be achieved on the day?
The workshop aims will be achieved through presentations and discussions. 
Prospective participants are invited to submit 4-6 page papers describing work in progress, or containing preliminary results to discuss with the community.
In order to stimulate interactions, the workshop will include short position paper presentations and poster sessions. 
The afternoon will be dedicated to discussion, including both a panel session and semi-structured group discussions.

\section{Organizers}
% some workshop abstracts include details about the organizers...but maybe we should avoid that given that it would produce a short novel.
